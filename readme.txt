Understanding Selectors Assignment

1. ID selectors can be a bad idea in CSS becuase they can sometimes be too 
specific. Contrasted with classes which can be used again, each ID instance
can only be used once and in one specifically defined way. It is also nice
that you can attach multiple classes within a single tag whereas each tag
can only have one ID.
2. From my knowledge and experience, the class selector seems to be more
efficient and effective. I also came across the * selector, probably most
for beginners I know, but it definitely might come in hand when styling a 
whole lot of code.
